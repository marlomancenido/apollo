Apollo is made as a companion website to an online forum game. Website has a lot of features to help with the mechanics of the game.

Website was last updated on June 3, 2020. It was made mostly in PHP. A copy of its database can be accessed in the database directory with the users' credentials censored. 

## Notes: 
- This is the source code of the website. To access website, [click here](https://apollo.6te.net). 
- Unfortunately, the website no longer allows log ins for authenticated features which include: uploading of videos, accessing the finance, collection of earnings, and other elements only visible to logged in users. 
- Most of the website is still working along with its connection to the database.
